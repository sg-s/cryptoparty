# What?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptoparty),

> A CryptoParty is a grassroots global endeavour to introduce the basics of practical cryptography such as the Tor anonymity network, key signing parties, disk encryption and virtual private networks to the general public. The project primarily consists of a series of free public workshops.

### Why should I go to a cryptoparty?

* because it's fun
* to learn about the reality and dangers of mass surveillance 
* to learn some really cool mathematical concepts
* to learn how to use free software to protect your freedom
